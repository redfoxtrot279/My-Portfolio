# My Portfolio
<h1>Features</h1>

<ol>Buttons on navbar work and function as intended</ol>

<ol>Image is inside an oval and text wraps around the image</ol>

<ol>image background does not interfere with main text</ol>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<ol>it took me a bit to finally get the navbar cursors to work however whenever the website would be on a mobile phone or tablet the 
cursors would change to a dropdown menu that fails to open.</ol>

<ol>I managed to get the columns and rows to work as well with the paragraphs, but when the website goes onto a smaller device screen 
like a phone the text would overlap the column borders and text itself.</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Although this portfolio was very fun to make and enjoy there was a lot of factors that I struggled to fix or failed to do so.</p>

<p>I feel I need to practice more on html due to forgetting a couple key features that would make this homework project easier on me.</p>
