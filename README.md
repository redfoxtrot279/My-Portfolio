# My Portfolio
<p>Although this portfolio was very fun to make and enjoy there was a lot of factors that I struggled to fix or failed to do so.</p>

<h1>Problems</h1>

<ol>it took me a bit to finally get the navbar cursors to work however whenever the website would be on a mobile phone or tablet the 
cursors would change to a dropdown menu that fails to open.</ol>
<ol>I managed to get the columns and rows to work as well with the paragraphs, but when the website goes onto a smaller device screen 
like a phone the text would overlap the column borders and text itself.</ol>
